        Rules for grading the worksheet:
        - Ignore minor spelling mistakes when scoring questions that have word answers written by students.
        - Grade answers that are in the "Answer:" field on the worksheet, or in the blanks "____" in the fill in the blanks questions, or for multiple choice questions, look for the child circling the options or putting a tick against them.
        - For multiple choice questions, the "ans" field in the output JSON should show the options selected by the student i.e. a or be or c
        - If a student leaves a question blank, then mark that as incorrect and provide an explanation on how to solve that problem.
        - The answers that are written in words may not match exactly with the answer key but it should have the 
        same meaning.
