Each phase of the model\u2014Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate\u2014plays a vital role in the teaching and learning process.\\n    1. Engage: The engage phase aims to capture students' attention and generate interest in the topic. It involves activities or discussions that activate prior knowledge, stimulate curiosity, and create a connection between the students' experiences and the new concepts being taught.\\n    2. Explore: In the explore phase, students actively participate in hands-on activities, investigations, and experiments. They explore the mathematical concepts, make observations, ask questions, and collect data. This phase encourages students to develop critical thinking skills, engage in problem-solving, and discover patterns and relationships.\\n    3. Explain: The explain phase focuses on providing explanations, clarifying concepts, and developing a deeper understanding. Teachers facilitate discussions, present mathematical principles, and guide students in making connections between their observations and the underlying mathematical concepts.\\n    4. Elaborate: In the elaborate phase, students apply their understanding of the concepts in real-life contexts. They engage in extended activities, solve complex problems, and work on projects that require higher-order thinking skills. This phase encourages students to explore mathematics beyond the classroom and strengthens their problem-solving abilities.\\n    5. Evaluate: The evaluate phase involves assessing students' learning outcomes and understanding. Various assessment strategies, including formative and summative assessments, are used to measure students' progress and provide feedback for further improvement.\\n    \",)\n    \n    Training Guidelines: \n    \n    1. Make sure to slow down and repeat important concepts so that all students understand.\n    2. Ask questions to multiple children in the class.\n    3.
